I used data from “2018 Sierra Club Cool Schools Rankings”

On my local desktop I can download file, move to appropriate directory, use python3 -m http.server, go to chrome at http://localhost:8000/, click on desired html file.

“18SierraClubRankings_vis2.js” is a script containing most of the text and all of the d3 objects. It is sourced/used by “18SierraClubRankings_vis.html,” which is the master html document that allows us to view in the browser.

“2018CoolSchools_SierraClub.csv” is the csv file. 

“colorbrewer.min.js” is a script I borrowed.

“assignment4_pdf” is just the pdf document containing written explanations.
